#### Image Resizing

The objective of this 1st assignment is to implement image resizing techniques and explore their effectiveness in handling different scaling scenarios. The task involves reducing and enlarging images through various interpolation methods, providing insights into their performance and visual quality. Specifically, the assignment consists of the following:

1. Reducing the size of an image by a scale factor k<1k<1 using the nearest-neighbor technique.
1.1 (Bonus): Implementing image reduction by averaging neighboring pixels.

2. Enlarging an image by a scale factor k=2k=2 (creating exactly one gap between pixel pairs) using both zero-order and first-order interpolation.

3. Enlarging an image by an integer scale factor kk using zero-order and first-order interpolation.
3.1 (Bonus): Implementing enlargement for real scale factors k≥1k≥1 using first-order interpolation.

Through this assignment, we aim to understand the trade-offs between different interpolation methods and their impact on image quality across various scaling scenarios.
